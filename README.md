  ## Description
   This week's assignment was to build a backend API for social networks. It has the ability to add users, and connect other users as friends. Additionally, users can write their thoughts in the form of posts, and other users can write reactions. This API is good for someone who wants to create a social network, but wants to focus more on the concept rather than the basic functionality.
   
   To build this API, I used Node.js, Express.js, and Moment.js. The database was built with MongoDB, and I wrote the functionality with Mongoose.js.

  ## Installation
  The user must have a source code editor tool, such as VS Code, TextEdit on Mac, or NotePad on Windows. Additionally, the user will need node.js installed. 
  
  Once those tools are installed, hit the “code” button in this repository and copy the link. In your command line, type "git clone" followed by pasting the copied link to clone onto your own local machine. 
  
  Once you're in your project via the code editing software as well as in the command line, use CL command `npm install` to install all dependencies.
  
  ## Usage
  This application could be used for anyone looking to bulid a social networking app, whether it's for school, work, or for fun.
